# Serialization_Deserialization

### Serialization
It is the process of converting an object (e.g., python object) to another file format (e.g., pickle, json)

### Deserialization 
It is the inverse process of Serialization

### How is the code structured?

Firstly, I created a class Student in the file called `student_class.py`
Secondly, I imported `pickle`, `joblib`, and the class created.
Thirdly, I created the joblib and pickle files (Serialization)
Finally, I converted the joblib and pickle files into python objects.

Note that you can use either joblib or pickle or yaml or json. In my case, I choose to work with pickle and joblib.
